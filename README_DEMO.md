📝 Little Sprouts AI: Interviewer Demo Guide
Welcome to the Little Sprouts "Front Desk" Prototype. To see the full range of the AI's capabilities, please follow these three testing paths:

🌟 Scenario 1: The "Busy Parent" (Logged In)
Goal: Showcases "Daily Feed" integration and warm, personal tone.

Login: Use phone number 555-0101 (Enter any 4-digit code).

Interaction: Click the "Check on Leo" button or type "How is my boy doing?"

What to look for: The AI recognizes James, knows Leo is napping, and mentions his specific teacher (Ms. Rachel).

🤒 Scenario 2: The "Sick Child" (Guided Flow)
Goal: Showcases "Handbook Compliance" and "Action-Oriented" UI.

Login: Use phone number 555-0202 (Elena).

Interaction: Click the "Sick Policy" action chip or type "Maya has a fever."

What to look for: The AI identifies Maya's teething status, quotes the 24-hour fever-free policy, and offers a "Notify Ms. Sarah" button to bridge the gap between info and action.

🥪 Scenario 3: The "Logistics Gap" (Action Trigger)
Goal: Showcases revenue-generating features (Brightwheel billing simulation).

Login: Use phone number 555-0303 (Sarah Chen).

Interaction: Type "I forgot Cooper's lunch today!"

What to look for: The AI checks the menu for the day, quotes the $5 fee, and offers a "Charge my Account" button.

🏢 Scenario 4: The "Prospective Parent" (Guest)
Goal: Showcases safety/privacy and enrollment conversion.

Login: Select "Continue as Guest."

Interaction: Ask "How is Leo doing today?" then ask "What is your infant tuition?"

The AI refuses to give info on Leo (Privacy).

The AI gives the Infant Tuition ($450/week) and suggests booking a tour.

👩‍💻 Scenario 5: The "Operator View" (Admin)
Goal: Showcases "Human-in-the-Loop" and system improvement.

Navigate: Go to /admin.
